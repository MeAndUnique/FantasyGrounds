						<p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency in either Intimidation, Deception, or Persuasion. If you already have proficiency in one of these skills, you may instead choose to gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.

						<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
						<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
						<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
						<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
						<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

						<p>Upon reaching 2nd level, you learn to use the power of hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, place a seal on a target within 30’. You can do this a number of times equal to your charisma modifier. You replenish all your seals after a <b>short or long rest</b>.</p>
						<p>When you or an ally hits a target you can see with a seal on them, you may consume the seals to cause the attack to deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on the target per seal consumed. If you are within 30 feet of the target, you heal two points of damage for each die of damage your seals inflict.</p>
						<p>A creature with a seal on them is an <i>interdicted</i> creature.</p>
						<p>Seals evaporate if not used after one minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there; it appears in the illrigger’s sight as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead. If a creature with one of your seals on it dies, you may move the seal to another creature within range.</p>
						<p>Upon reaching 10th level you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals inflict an extra 1d6 damage.</p>
						<p>Your seals improve differently based on which contract you choose. These improvements are listed under your contract, below.</p>

							<i>The shadowmasters serve Moloch and excel at stealth and disguise, the hidden assassins of Hell.</i>
						</p>
						<p>Moloch is the Lord of Styx, the City of Lies. He strives to rule Hell through subterfuge, deceit and trickery. His illriggers are assassins, striking from the shadows or using deception to earn high ranking positions close to powerful rulers. Many shadowmasters run networks of spies and assassins who have no idea the infernal provenance of their master.</p>
						<p>The shadowmasters are sworn not to reveal themselves and to take their own lives before betraying their true allegiance. Many Shadowmasters have elaborate plans ready for their own assassination so that, should someone get close to discovering their true identity, they will be killed by their own assassins, preserving the truth. Of course, these killers have no idea who they were really working for…</p>

						<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
						<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
						<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
						<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
						<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

						<p>When you or an ally hits a target you can see with a seal on them, you may consume the seals to cause the attack to deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on the target per seal consumed.

						<p>A creature with a seal on them is an <i>interdicted</i> creature.</p>
						<p>Seals evaporate if not used after one minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there; it appears in the illrigger’s sight as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead. If a creature with one of your seals on it dies, you may move the seal to another creature within range.</p>
						<p>Upon reaching 10th level you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals inflict an extra 1d6 damage.</p>

						<p>At 6th level, your connection to Moloch's power deepens. If you hit an interdicted creature with a melee attack before the end of your turn, you can mark them for death. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls that do not include you until the end of its next turn. While that creature is interdicted it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) whenever it tries to leave your reach. On a failure, its speed instead becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. These effects last until it is no longer interdicted, you leave it's reach, or it leaves your reach.</p>

						<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
						<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
						<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
						<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
						<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

						<p>Upon reaching 2nd level, you learn to use the power of hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, place a seal on a target within 30’. You can do this a number of times equal to your charisma modifier. You replenish all your seals after a <b>short or long rest</b>.</p>
						<p>When you or an ally hits a target you can see with a seal on them, you may consume the seals to cause the attack to deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on the target per seal consumed. If you are within 30 feet of the target, you heal two points of damage for each die of damage your seals inflict.</p>
						<p>A creature with a seal on them is an <i>interdicted</i> creature.</p>
						<p>Seals evaporate if not used after one minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there; it appears in the illrigger’s sight as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead. If a creature with one of your seals on it dies, you may move the seal to another creature within range.</p>
						<p>Upon reaching 10th level you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals inflict an extra 1d6 damage.</p>

							<i>Hell’s Architects are cool and calculating arcane knights who deploy spell, steel and subterfuge to win the battle at any cost.</i>
						</p>
						<p>Asmodeus is the Lord of Acheron, the City of Fear. His illriggers scour the timescape collecting secrets and spells designed to deceive and terrify his opponents. The war he fights against the other Lords of Hell is one of deception and propaganda.</p>
						<p>Acheron’s illriggers work to make Hell’s enemies seem outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Half their strategy involves research and infiltration, the other half illusion and propaganda. When an Architect of Ruin finally confronts an enemy, they see the illrigger’s forces as impossibly powerful, while their own allies betray them and their armies flee in fear.</p>

						<p>When Asmodeus accepts you as an Architect of Ruin, you gain access to his infernal power and learn to access divine magic to cast illrigger spells.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Cantrips.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the illrigger spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at 8th level.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Spell Slots.</b> The Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of these spells you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
						<p>You prepare the list of illrigger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the illrigger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of illrigger spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half yourillrigger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
						<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level illrigger, you have three 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell hell’s lash , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
						<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of illrigger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Spellcasting Ability</b>
						</p>
						<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your illrigger spells, since their power derives from your ability to command the attention of your patron archdevil. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an illrigger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Spell save DC =</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
						<p>
							<b>Spell attack modifier =</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

						<p>If you do not have enough spent slots to use all the slots you recover, you recover all you can and ignore the excess. For instance, if you roll a 4, but only have one spent 1st level slot, you recover that slot and ignore the excess.</p>

						<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
						<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
						<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
						<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
						<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

						<p>At 20th level you may use your action to become a Lore Devil for one minute. Your Charisma becomes 24 (+7) increasing your number of seals, your spell DC, and any other charisma-based effects accordingly. Any ongoing spells you are maintaining from before you transformed into a Lore Devil keep their original DC. You emanate an interference aura, forcing any creature within 60’ attempting to cast a spell to first succeed at a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or the spell fails and they lose the spell slot.</p>
						<p>At the start of each of your turns, you roll 1d4 and recover that many levels in spell slots. You may combine these slots however you wish. If you roll a four, you may recover four 1st level spell slots, one 4th level spell slot, two 2nd level slots, or one 3rd level and one 1st level slot.</p>
						<p>If you do not have enough spent slots to use all the slots you recover, you recover all you can and ignore the excess. For instance, if you roll a 4, but only have one spent 1st level slot, you recover that slot and ignore the excess.</p>
						<p>You replenish this ability after a long rest. At their discretion, your GM may choose one codex and grant you limited use of one of the abilities from that codex.</p>

						<p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency in either Intimidation, Deception, or Persuasion. If you already have proficiency in one of these skills, you may instead choose to gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.

						<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
						<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
						<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
						<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
						<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

						<p>Upon reaching 2nd level, you learn to use the power of hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, place a seal on a target within 30’. You can do this a number of times equal to your charisma modifier. You replenish all your seals after a <b>short or long rest</b>.</p>
						<p>When you or an ally hits a target you can see with a seal on them, you may consume the seals to cause the attack to deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on the target per seal consumed. If you are within 30 feet of the target, you heal two points of damage for each die of damage your seals inflict.</p>
						<p>A creature with a seal on them is an <i>interdicted</i> creature.</p>
						<p>Seals evaporate if not used after one minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there; it appears in the illrigger’s sight as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead. If a creature with one of your seals on it dies, you may move the seal to another creature within range.</p>
						<p>Upon reaching 10th level you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals inflict an extra 1d6 damage.</p>

							<i>The heavily armored death troopers of hell, the Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.</i>
						</p>
						<p>Dispater is the Lord of Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater’s army does the fighting and the dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. They are full of pride and hubris and present themselves as lordly, often having a fastidious obsession with their personal appearance.</p>
						<p>The Painkillers are among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, but theirs is a twisted chivalry. They will accept and honor a challenge to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere. But they will cheat if losing and toy with an enemy before finishing them, if winning.</p>
						<p>In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another World might see their army facing certain defeat and call upon Dispater. Seeing the opportunity to sow strife and discord, Dispater might send a Painkiller to lead the desperate lord’s armies.</p>

						<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
						<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
						<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
						<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
						<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

						<p>Upon reaching 2nd level, you learn to use the power of hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, place a seal on a target within 30’. You can do this a number of times equal to your charisma modifier. You replenish all your seals after a <b>short or long rest</b>.</p>
						<p>When you or an ally hits a target you can see with a seal on them, you may consume the seals to cause the attack to deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on the target per seal consumed. If you are within 30 feet of the target, you heal two points of damage for each die of damage your seals inflict.</p>
						<p>A creature with a seal on them is an <i>interdicted</i> creature.</p>
						<p>Seals evaporate if not used after one minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there; it appears in the illrigger’s sight as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead. If a creature with one of your seals on it dies, you may move the seal to another creature within range.</p>
						<p>Upon reaching 10th level you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals inflict an extra 1d6 damage.</p>
						<p>Your seals improve differently based on which contract you choose. These improvements are listed under your contract, below.</p>

								<i>The heavily armored death troopers of hell, the Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.</i>
							</p>
							<p>Dispater is the Lord of Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater’s army does the fighting and the dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. They are full of pride and hubris and present themselves as lordly, often having a fastidious obsession with their personal appearance.</p>
							<p>The Painkillers are among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, but theirs is a twisted chivalry. They will accept and honor a challenge to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere. But they will cheat if losing and toy with an enemy before finishing them, if winning.</p>
							<p>In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another World might see their army facing certain defeat and call upon Dispater. Seeing the opportunity to sow strife and discord, Dispater might send a Painkiller to lead the desperate lord’s armies.</p>

								<i>The shadowmasters serve Moloch and excel at stealth and disguise, the hidden assassins of Hell.</i>
							</p>
							<p>Moloch is the Lord of Styx, the City of Lies. He strives to rule Hell through subterfuge, deceit and trickery. His illriggers are assassins, striking from the shadows or using deception to earn high ranking positions close to powerful rulers. Many shadowmasters run networks of spies and assassins who have no idea the infernal provenance of their master.</p>
							<p>The shadowmasters are sworn not to reveal themselves and to take their own lives before betraying their true allegiance. Many Shadowmasters have elaborate plans ready for their own assassination so that, should someone get close to discovering their true identity, they will be killed by their own assassins, preserving the truth. Of course, these killers have no idea who they were really working for…</p>

							<p>There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at first level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the illrigger chart. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.</p>
							<p>As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. On a miss, nothing happens, you do not roll or lose your pool dice. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.</p>
							<p>The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If touching an ally they gain that many hit points, ignoring any excess above their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
							<p>If touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you are fully healed, you may use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points.</p>
							<p>At 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy you may also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life.</p>

							<p>
								<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Cantrips.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the illrigger spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at 8th level.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Spell Slots.</b> The Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of these spells you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
							<p>You prepare the list of illrigger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the illrigger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of illrigger spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half yourillrigger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
							<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level illrigger, you have three 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell hell’s lash , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
							<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of illrigger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Spellcasting Ability</b>
							</p>
							<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your illrigger spells, since their power derives from your ability to command the attention of your patron archdevil. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an illrigger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Spell save DC =</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
							<p>
								<b>Spell attack modifier =</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

					<h>The Illrigger</h>
					<p>The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme and plot endlessly, eternally. Each seeks to bring the others to heel. To ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the seven cities and every infernal thing that lives there, and lead an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.</p>
					<p>Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the illriggers. Knights of hell, they are high charisma counter-paladins who master devils, disrupt enemy organizations, and command Hell’s armies.</p>
					<h>The Order of Desolation</h>
					<p>Acceptance into the Order of Illriggers makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil you serve. Each archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But the association of illriggers consider themselves an order of knights who serve Hell rather than cultists slavishly devoted to a single Archdevil.</p>
					<p>Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be independent, intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult may believe that the presence of an illrigger in their midst is a sign that their archdevil approves of their actions, but the illriggers are independent. The order was founded to give the Lords of Hell agents capable of acting across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron. An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron’s trust. Left to their own devices, the illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision.</p>
					<p>It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to rely on other members of the order first, even from illriggers who serve other archdevils before going to any church, cult, or temple to their own archdevil.</p>

					<p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).</p>
					<p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the reference.imagedata. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
					<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>

The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target t of all asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.</p>
					<p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>
					<p>If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

					<h>v2.0</h>
					<p>The Illrigger is MCDM’s first custom class. Illriggers are intended to be versatile armored warriors with a wide array of supernatural abilities that reflect the infernal source of their power. Depending on their contract they can be highly mobile stealthy assassins, heavily armored battlefield commanders, or fighting mages and anti-mages. We hope you like this beta test, your feedback will make the class more fun and playable for everyone.</p>
					<p>The Illrigger is weird: one of its core abilities, Baleful Interdict, improves based on which Archdevil you serve. So instead of three improvements to one ability listed at the top of the document, Baleful Interdict is described once, but then under each specialty there are three dif erent improvements. We think this allows the different Illrigger specializations to shine and feel unique. 3rd party design is a good place for such weirdness, we feel.</p>
					<p>At this point the Illrigger has undergone a lot of testing and revision. We’ll always be updating the class based on how people are using it, but we feel the current text largely reflects our design goals.</p>
					<p>If you get the chance, please use the illrigger in your game and report back. Often, something will <b>seem</b> complex or overpowered or underpowered when you read it, but then it turns out not to be a problem in play. It’s very easy to <b>imagine</b> scenarios where an ability might be unbalanced, but in <b>practice</b> that scenario might be very rare.</p>

					<h>General Notes</h>
					<p>A pregenerated 20th level character for each subclass is provided as an example of how one might set up the abilities on the Actions tab. While each ability may be copied by dragging and dropping, the groups cannot and will require manual setup for tracking uses. See below for additional notes on each ability.</p>
					<h>The Illrigger</h>
					<p><b>Forked Tongue</b></p>
					<p>Manage via the skills tab.</p>
					<p><b>Infernal Conduit</b></p>
					<p>The healing effect, unfortunately, must be done manually as there is not a built-in mechanism for health transfer. Also, take care to negate any resistance or vulnerability your might have yourself when transfering health to an ally.</p>
					<p>Note that the Exhaustion effect should either be removed or ignored until level 11.</p>
					<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>
					<p>Treachery is shown on the example characters. The other options can be handled by updating the appropriate fields directly.</p>
					<p><b>Baleful Interdict</b></p>
					<p>The interdicted effect is useful for tracking which enemy has a seal, though it does have the shortcoming of needing to be removed manually.</p>
					<p>Note that the damage has not been increased even though the example characters are level 20.</p>
					<p><b>Hellsight</b></p>
					<p>The effect is just for tracking purposes.</p>
					<p><b>Aura of Desolation</b></p>
					<p>As of 06 May 2020 there is a bug in Fantasy Grounds Unity preventing the appropriate function of negative die effects. Your mileage may vary.</p>
					<p><b>Summon Hell</b></p>
					<p>Set up to track weekly use. Will require manually resetting per week. Also requires manual summoning of a Bone Devil.</p>
					<h>Shadowmaster</h>
					<p><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
					<p>Manage via the Skills tab.</p>
					<p><b>Invoke Authority</b></p>
					<p>Moloch's blessing is included for usage tracking.</p>
					<p><b>Flash of Brimstone</b></p>
					<p>Movement must ben handled manually.</p>
					<p><b>Relentless</b></p>
					<p>Update character move speed.</p>
					<p><b>Only a Memory</b></p>
					<p>It is assumed that most stealth checks are for hiding, and thus get the benefit. If your game uses stealth checks frequently where the benefit should not apply, consider not using the effect and instead manually applying advantage as needed.</p>
					<p><b>Evasion</b></p>
					<p>'Nuff said</p>
					<p><b>A Dark and Vile Mist</b></p>
					<p>The "oops I hurt myself" button is provided for your convenience.</p>
					<p><b>Hell's Assassin</b></p>
					<p>Simply the change the damage die.</p>
					<p><b>Shadowform</b></p>
					<p>Be aware that <i>all</i> damage is converted to necrotic by the effect, so it will need to be skipped for a roll by the DM if another damage type should be caused by a non-weapon.</p>
					<h>PainKiller</h>
					<p><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>
					<p>Manage via the Skills tab.</p>
					<p><b>Invoke Authority</b></p>
					<p>Both options are present for tracking usage.</p>
					<p><b>I Am Death</b></p>
					<p>Shift+drag to target.</p>
					<p><b>Battlefield Commander</b></p>
					<p>Directly modify the chosen ability.</p>
					<p><b>Leadership</b></p>
					<p>Apply to allies for fun and profit. Keep blinded and deafened in mind, as there isn't a way to automate that conditional logic.</p>
					<p><b>Hell's Fury</b></p>
					<p>Swing away.</p>
					<p><b>You Die on My Command</b></p>
					<p>Heal that 1 hp.</p>
					<p><b>Steelmind</b></p>
					<p>It just works.</p>
					<p><b>Deathstrike</b></p>
					<p>Regrettably unable to automate.</p>
					<p><b>Pain Devil</b></p>
					<p>Size will need to be manually adjusted. The health impact of increasing constitution is difficult in Fantsy Grounds. Temporary hitpoints (assuming a base constitution score of 20) is a convenient workaround if lacking in areas such as interaction with actual temporary hitpoints or healing back up to full.</p>
					<h>Architect of Ruin</h>
					<p><b>Invoke Authority</b></p>
					<p>Spellbreaker is included for usage tracking.</p>
					<p>The Spellmaster implementation may require some manual effect management if the following assumptions are incorrect:</p>
					<p>*the spell being concentrated on will last for 1 minute.</p>
					<p>*concentration on the spell will not be ended volunatrily in favor of a different concentration spell.</p>
					<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>
					<p>Due to the Illrigger having a unique spell slot progression, they will need to be corrected manually when levelling.</p>
					<p><b>Hellmage</b></p>
					<p>Nothing to automate, just mark the seal as used.</p>
					<p><b>Veteran of Sorcery</b></p>
					<p>Included for usage tracking.</p>
					<p><b>This is no Illusion</b></p>
					<p>Must be handled manually as there isn't any way to automate checks just for illusions.</p>
					<p><b>Submit!</b></p>
					<p>Apply the effect before the enemy makes their save.</p>
					<p><b>By Will Alone</b></p>
					<p>Nothing to automate.</p>
					<p><b>Asmodeus' Blessing</b></p>
					<p>Simply apply damage when hit.</p>
					<p><b>Magic Resistance</b></p>
					<p>Magic Resistance can't be automated to apply on in regard to a target's spells, so this will need to be done manually.</p>
					<p><b>Lore Devil</b></p>
					<p>Spell recouperation and extra seals must be handled manually.</p>
					<p>If there are any ongoing spells from prior the "Pre-Lore Devil Spell" effect may be applied to the target as needed prior to them making repeated saving throws.</p>
					<h>New Spells</h>
					<p><b>Aura of Desecration</b></p>
					<p>Healing will need to be handled manually. Default parsing uses rounds instead of minutes.</p>
					<p><b>Hell's Lash</b></p>
					<p>The default parsing has a redundant instance of the damage and has a 1 round duration instead of 1 minute.</p>
					<p><b>Mote of Hell</b></p>
					<p>Added blinded effect. It lasts for one round as an assumed method for verifying effect and position.</p>
					<p>Added self effect for tracking concentration.</p>
					<p><b>Single Combat</b></p>
					<p>Added an effect for tracking target and duration, otherwise everything must be handled manually.</p>
					<p><b>Wall of Death</b></p>
					<p>The default parsing has a redundant instance of the damage and has a 1 round duration instead of 1 minute.</p>
					<p>Healing and failed death save must be tracked manually.</p>
